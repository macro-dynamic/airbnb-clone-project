## üß± Technology Stack

This project uses a modern backend development stack to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability.

| Technology            | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Python**             | The core programming language used to build the backend logic. |

| **GitHub Actions**     | Provides CI/CD automation for testing and deploying the project on every code push or pull request. |


## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The AirBnB Clone backend relies on a relational database schema implemented in **PostgreSQL**. Below are the core entities and their relationships, aligned with the project‚Äôs REST API endpoints and features.

### üîë Key Entities

#### 1. Users
Stores information for both guests and hosts.

**Important Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password` (hashed)
- `is_host` (Boolean: true if user can list properties)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

#### 2. Properties
Represents listings created by hosts.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location` (city, country, address)
- `price_per_night`
- `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `created_at`

#### 3. Bookings
Tracks property reservations made by users.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK to Users)
- `property_id` (FK to Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `status` (pending, confirmed, cancelled)
- `created_at`

#### 4. Payments
Handles transactions for bookings.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`
- `booking_id` (FK to Bookings)
- `amount`
- `status` (e.g., success, failed)
- `payment_method`
- `paid_at`

#### 5. Reviews
Stores user feedback for properties.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK to Users)
- `property_id` (FK to Properties)
- `rating` (e.g., 1‚Äì5)
- `comment`
- `created_at`

---

### üîó Entity Relationships

- A **User** can act as a **guest** or a **host**.
- A **Host (User)** can create multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**, each linked to a specific **Property**.
- A **Booking** has exactly one **Payment**.
- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews** about **Properties** they‚Äôve booked.
- A **Property** can have many **Reviews** and **Bookings**.

This structure ensures clear referential integrity and aligns with the provided API endpoints.


## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

This project implements core functionalities of a property rental platform, replicating key workflows of Airbnb from both user and host perspectives.

### üßë‚Äçüíº 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication ensures secure access, and profile features support both guests and hosts depending on user roles.

### üè† 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details like title, description, price, and location. These listings form the core inventory available to users for booking.

### üìÖ 3. Booking System
Users can browse listings and book properties for specific dates. The system manages availability, check-in/check-out dates, and booking status (pending, confirmed, canceled).

### üí≥ 4. Payment Processing
Secure payment handling is implemented to process transactions related to bookings. Each booking is tied to a single payment record, and transaction status is tracked for success or failure.

### ‚≠ê 5. Review System
After their stay, users can leave reviews and star ratings for properties. This builds trust in the platform and provides valuable feedback for both hosts and future guests.

### üöÄ 6. API Design (REST + GraphQL)
RESTful endpoints are provided for all core resources using Django REST Framework. Optional GraphQL support allows flexible, client-driven querying for performance and precision.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Optimization & Performance
Includes database indexing and Redis-based caching to optimize query performance. Celery is used for background tasks like sending notifications or handling asynchronous payments.


üîê API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to maintaining the integrity, privacy, and trustworthiness of the AirBnB Clone platform. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project, along with the reasons behind each:

1. Authentication
What: Verifies user identity using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).

Why: Prevents unauthorized access to the system and ensures that only registered users can perform certain actions (e.g., booking, reviewing).

2. Authorization
What: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for users (e.g., host vs guest).

Why: Ensures users can only access or modify data they are allowed to (e.g., a host cannot delete another host‚Äôs property).

3. Rate Limiting
What: Restricts the number of API requests allowed per user/IP within a time window.

Why: Protects the system from abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

4. Input Validation & Sanitization
What: Validates all incoming data and sanitizes user input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).

Why: Prevents attackers from exploiting malformed data to compromise the system or extract sensitive information.

5. HTTPS Enforcement
What: Ensures all data exchanged between clients and the server is encrypted using HTTPS.

Why: Protects sensitive data (passwords, payment info) from being intercepted during transmission.

6. Secure Payment Handling
What: Delegates payment processing to a trusted external payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).

Why: Reduces the risk of mishandling financial data and ensures compliance with PCI-DSS standards.

7. Session & Token Expiry
What: Enforces expiration of session tokens and refresh tokens.

Why: Limits exposure time if a token is compromised, and reduces the risk of replay attacks.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the testing, building, and deployment process of the backend application. This ensures that code changes are automatically verified and deployed, reducing the risk of bugs and improving team productivity.

### ‚úÖ Why It Matters
- **Continuous Integration** ensures that new code is automatically tested and validated before merging, helping catch issues early.
- **Continuous Deployment** enables fast, reliable delivery of new features and fixes to staging or production environments.
- CI/CD reduces manual errors, accelerates release cycles, and improves overall software quality.

### üß∞ Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, linting, migrations, and deployment workflows for every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Packages the backend and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS / DigitalOcean (optional)**: Can be used as hosting platforms for staging or production environments.
- **Coverage.py & pytest**: Used in the testing pipeline to track code quality and unit test success.
